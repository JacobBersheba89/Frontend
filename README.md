## Features

- Collecting data from various sensors.
- Displaying real-time data.
- Data export and analysis options.

## Technologies

- **Arduino** for data collection.
- **Python** for data processing and display.
- **Graphical interface** for visualization.
- **Lua** for programin RB motherboard

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
